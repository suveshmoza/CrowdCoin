# CrowdCoin

- A decentralized crowdfunding platform based on the ethereum blockchain.
- The project is a decentralized crowdfunding application, built to solve the problem of money being misused by people, collected using the traditional crowdfunding applications.
- Blockchain helped in keeping track of the money collected using the application, and storing it under the control of a piece of code.
- Hence not letting the money get into the hands of anyone and removing every possibility of it getting misused. Thus allowing us to reach to a logical solution to the problem in hand.
- Same as crowd funding in the real world, you can create campaigns requiring minimum contribution.
- The creator can propose how to use money and how much money is needed as a 'Request'.He cannot use money without more than 50% approvers in voting.
